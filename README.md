# Bug Bounty

To perform a successful bug bounty, you need a structured workflow that covers reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and reporting. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide for an effective bug bounty workflow:

### 1. **Understanding the Scope**

- **Read the program’s rules and scope**: Carefully review the target's scope, including what systems, domains, and vulnerabilities are allowed. Understand any legal implications and rules around testing (e.g., restricted areas, production vs. test environments).
- **Focus on out-of-scope exclusions**: Some bounty programs explicitly restrict certain types of tests (e.g., denial-of-service, physical attacks). Avoid these.

### 2. **Reconnaissance (Recon)**

Start by gathering as much information as possible about the target.

### 2.1 **Passive Reconnaissance**

- **Subdomain Enumeration**:
    - Tools: `Amass`, `Sublist3r`, `Assetfinder`
    - Command: `amass enum -passive -d example.com`
- **DNS Enumeration**:
    - Tools: `dnsrecon`, `dnsenum`
    - Command: `dnsrecon -d example.com`
- **Google Dorking**: Use Google search queries to find exposed resources or interesting files.
    - Example: `site:example.com filetype:pdf`

### 2.2 **Active Reconnaissance**

- **Port Scanning**:
    - Tools: `Nmap`
    - Command: `nmap -sS -p- -T4 example.com`
- **Service Enumeration**: Identify services running on open ports.
    - Command: `nmap -sV -p 80,443,22 example.com`
- **Directory Brute Forcing**:
    - Tools: `Gobuster`, `Dirbuster`
    - Command: `gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

### 3. **Vulnerability Identification**
